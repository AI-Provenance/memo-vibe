# DevMemory Auto-Context

If `.devmemory/CONTEXT.md` exists, **read it at the start of every task**.
It contains a pre-built briefing with relevant architecture decisions,
known gotchas, and coordination state for your current work area.

Run `devmemory context` in the terminal to refresh it before starting work.

This file is auto-generated based on the current git branch, changed files,
and recent commits. It complements — but does not replace — deeper searches
via `search_long_term_memory()` through MCP when you need specific answers.
